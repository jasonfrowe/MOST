Source Code for CSA's MOST Mission (jasonfrowe@gmail.com)

Requires:  X11,PGPlot,CFITSIO libraries (-lX11 -lpgplot -lcfitsio)
**If you use OS/X I recommend 'homebrew' to install pgplot and cfitsio
  and XQuartz for X11.
**If you are a Linux fan, either use your favourite package installer
  (e.g., yum) or install pgplot/cfitsio from source.  

Quick INSTALL:

 ./configure
 make

**I'm new to using autoconf, so if you run into trouble - let me know.

This should make binaries in the 'bin' directory.

allMOST: aperture and PSF extraction for subrastered FITS files for the
MOST mission.  This is probably the code you are looking for! 

mostfit3: Attempts to decorrelate sky-background and flux-values.  This
is a necessary step due to non-linear behaviour between incident flux and
background levels.  

mostfit4: Does a simulateous fit to the sky-background and centroid 
position relative to the aperture flux for decorrelation.

orbitremove: Does a brute-force removal of power at the MOST orbital 
frequency.

autocut: Examines PSF-shape and flux scatter to select the best data for
analysis

winsigclip: Performs sigma-clipping on a pre-defined window size.
